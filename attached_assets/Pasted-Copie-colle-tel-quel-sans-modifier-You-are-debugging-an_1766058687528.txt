You are debugging and cleaning an existing GSAP Hero animation.
This is NOT a redesign task — this is a timeline logic and visibility fix.

Current problems:
- Text appears alone without images
- Sometimes 1 image appears, sometimes 2
- Timeline desync causes black screen at the end
- Slides are not orchestrated as a unit
- Final state leaves nothing visible

GOAL:
Create a clean, cinematic, SEQUENTIAL hero animation with NO visual glitches.

REQUIRED BEHAVIOR (STRICT):

For EACH slide (1 → 2 → 3):

1) Slide becomes visible (opacity: 1)
2) BOTH images animate in together (left + right)
3) AFTER images are in place, the text fades in
4) Text stays visible briefly
5) Text fades out
6) Images split and exit (left up, right down)
7) Slide is hidden again (opacity: 0)
8) Next slide starts

FINAL STATE:
- After slide 3 finishes:
  - Either keep slide 3 text visible
  - OR keep one final static image
- NEVER leave the hero empty or black

TECHNICAL RULES (VERY IMPORTANT):

- Use ONE GSAP timeline only
- NO infinite loops
- NO overlapping slides visible at the same time
- Explicitly control opacity/visibility for each slide
- Each slide animation must be wrapped in its own timeline segment
- Reset clip-path and transforms BETWEEN slides
- Avoid relying on default CSS visibility

STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS:

- slides[] array with exactly 3 entries
- Each slide contains:
  - leftImage
  - rightImage
  - title
  - subtitle

HERO LAYOUT:
- Height: ~70vh (not fullscreen)
- Background: solid black
- Centered text

DOMAIN CONTEXT:
- Financial / Loan website
- Target: Individuals & Professionals
- Visuals must feel trustworthy, clean, professional

DELIVERABLES:
- Clean, corrected HeroSection.tsx
- Clean, corrected CSS
- Clearly commented GSAP timeline explaining each phase
- NO additional features
- NO visual glitches
- Production-ready code only

🔥 PHRASE BONUS (si Replit déraille encore)

Si après ça il refait n’importe quoi, envoie juste ceci :

Treat each slide as an atomic scene.
Never animate text or images outside their slide container.
If a slide is not active, it must be fully invisible.
