You are redesigning and restructuring a SPECIFIC PART of a production website.

IMPORTANT:
- DO NOT touch the Hero section.
- The Hero section is correct and must remain unchanged.
- The task starts IMMEDIATELY AFTER the Hero section
  and ends at the "Learn More" button.

Website context:
- Financial LOAN platform
- Target: Individuals & Professionals
- Brand tone: Trust, expertise, seriousness, premium finance
- This is NOT a startup showcase or tech product

────────────────────────────────────
1) CURRENT PROBLEMS TO FIX
────────────────────────────────────

The section after the Hero currently:
- Feels generic and template-like
- Uses card layouts that are too playful and pastel
- Lacks strong financial credibility
- Has weak visual hierarchy
- Does not guide the user clearly

This MUST be fixed.

────────────────────────────────────
2) REQUIRED RESTRUCTURING
────────────────────────────────────

Rebuild the section into a CLEAR FINANCIAL NARRATIVE:

A) EXPERTISE & POSITIONING
- Introduce credibility first
- Clearly explain what the company does
- Reinforce trust and experience

B) AREAS OF FINANCING (REORGANIZED)
- Rework the "Our areas of expertise" section
- Cards can be redesigned and repositioned
- Layout must feel structured and professional
- Clear separation between:
  - Business financing
  - Personal financing
  - Debt consolidation
  - Specialized / innovative solutions

C) PROOF & CONFIDENCE
- Present key figures (clients, amounts, satisfaction, countries)
- Improve spacing and alignment
- Make this section feel like institutional credibility, not marketing fluff

────────────────────────────────────
3) CARDS & LAYOUT RULES (VERY IMPORTANT)
────────────────────────────────────

Cards:
- May be redesigned completely
- Must look more BANKING / FINANCIAL
- Avoid soft pastel-only backgrounds
- Avoid playful rounded styles
- Use:
  - Subtle borders
  - Neutral backgrounds
  - Clear typography
  - Strong titles

Layout:
- Use grids intentionally
- Improve vertical rhythm
- Avoid stacking everything the same way

────────────────────────────────────
4) COLORS & VISUAL IDENTITY
────────────────────────────────────

Rework colors for this entire section only:
- More credible
- More neutral
- More premium

Rules:
- No flashy gradients
- No “startup SaaS” look
- Colors must work for a loan / finance website
- Ensure accessibility and contrast

────────────────────────────────────
5) CONTENT ENRICHMENT (OPTIONAL BUT WELCOME)
────────────────────────────────────

You MAY:
- Improve copy clarity
- Add meaningful icons
- Improve section titles
- Add short explanatory text where relevant

You MUST NOT:
- Add fake testimonials
- Modify the testimonials carousel appearance or content
- Add unrealistic or invented numbers

────────────────────────────────────
6) UX GOAL
────────────────────────────────────

After the Hero, the user should immediately understand:
- What the company finances
- Who it is for (individuals & professionals)
- Why it is trustworthy
- Why they should continue (Learn More)

The transition from Hero → Content → Learn More must feel smooth and logical.

────────────────────────────────────
FINAL EXPECTATION
────────────────────────────────────

The rebuilt section must be:
- Clean
- Professional
- Financially credible
- Better structured than before
- Clearly superior to the current layout

Do NOT overdesign.
Do NOT introduce experimental UI.
Do NOT touch the Hero section.

Output only production-ready code and styles.
