## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Technology Stack:** React 18 with TypeScript, Wouter for routing, Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui, Zustand for client-side state, TanStack Query for server state, React Hook Form with Zod, and Vite.
**Design System:** Radix UI primitives, custom HSL color system design tokens, Google Fonts, and a responsive mobile-first approach.
**Internationalization (i18n):** Custom Zustand-based implementation supporting 7 languages, with type-safe translation keys and IP-based automatic language detection.
**Theming:** Light/dark mode support via Zustand with localStorage persistence and CSS variables.
**Component Architecture:** Atomic design approach.

### Backend Architecture

**Technology Stack:** Node.js with Express.js, TypeScript, Drizzle ORM, PostgreSQL (via Neon serverless driver), and Connect-pg-simple for session management.
**API Design:** RESTful API endpoints with response formatting and request logging.
**Data Layer:** Schema-first design using Drizzle ORM, type-safe operations, Zod schemas, and drizzle-kit for migrations.
**Storage Strategy:** PostgreSQL database (`DatabaseStorage`) with Neon serverless, adhering to an `IStorage` interface.
**Database Schema:** Key tables include `users`, `loans`, `transfers`, `fees`, `transactions`, `adminSettings`, `auditLogs`, `transferValidationCodes`, `transferEvents`, `adminMessages`, `externalAccounts`, `userOtps`, and `kycDocuments`.

### UI/UX Decisions

- Virtual bank card fixed in the bottom-right of the dashboard.
- Welcome modal displayed once after the first login.
- Fully responsive design across all pages.
- Clear feedback and loading states for user actions.
- Password strength indicators during resets.
- Profile photo upload with dual cache-busting for immediate display.
- Homepage hero carousel with full-screen design, premium banking images, advanced animations, automatic rotation, and interactive controls.
- Professional PDF contract redesign with premium styling, structured information, and specific legal clauses.
- Automatic visual transfer progression with pause checkpoints requiring validation codes.
- Multi-channel notification system for contract signatures, including persistent banners, bell notifications, and email notifications.

### Technical Implementations

- **Authentication:** Comprehensive forgot/reset password with email notifications and rate limiting. Email verification includes automatic login. TOTP-based Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is optional. Single session enforcement and CSRF protection are implemented.
- **Session Management & Error Handling:** Global 401/403 interceptor redirects to login. `SessionMonitor` ensures periodic session validation. Intelligent retry logic.
- **Security Features:** IDOR protection, Zod validation, XSS protection, strong password requirements, UUID usernames, generic error messages, file upload validation with magic byte verification. Comprehensive rate limiting on sensitive endpoints. Encrypted 2FA secrets. All file uploads (KYC, signed contracts, profile photos) use Cloudinary with `type:'authenticated'` and cryptographic UUIDs. SSL configuration hardened for production.
- **Loan Disbursement Workflow:** Multi-step approval process (Request -> Admin Approval -> Contract Signing -> Manual Admin Fund Disbursement).
- **KYC Document Upload:** Cloudinary-based authenticated file storage with cryptographic UUID identifiers. Automatic cleanup of local temporary files.
- **Profile Photo Upload:** Cloudinary cloud-based image storage with `type:'authenticated'`, automatic transformations, and secure HTTPS URLs.
- **Signed Contracts:** Fully migrated to Cloudinary authenticated storage.
- **Notification System:** Database-backed persistent notifications with RESTful API, user ownership enforcement, `NotificationBell` component with polling, unread count badges, sound alerts, and a 2FA suggestion system. Supports multilingual notifications and covers 18 distinct critical user events.
- **Loan Workflow Enhancement:** Implemented a 3-stage contract lifecycle with `status` and `contractStatus` fields for clear tracking.
