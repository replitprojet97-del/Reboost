# ALTUS - Professional Loan Platform

## Overview

ALTUS is a multi-language professional loan management platform for business clients, offering a comprehensive dashboard for managing loans, transfers, fees, and financial transactions. It supports multiple languages (French, English, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, German, Dutch) and includes features like an interactive amortization calculator, real-time transfer tracking, external bank account management, KYC document upload, and financial analytics. The platform aims to provide robust tools for loan financing and financial management, ensuring a secure environment for financial operations.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language. High standards for security, SEO, and code quality - all implementations must be production-ready.

## Recent Changes (December 2, 2025)

- **Loan Visibility Fix:** Fixed bug where loans disappeared after admin approval. Loans now remain visible in "pending" tab until funds are released and available for transfer. Only then do they move to "active" status.
- **Loan Filtering Logic:** Updated IndividualLoans.tsx, ActiveLoans.tsx, and AppSidebar.tsx to use consistent filtering:
  - Active loans: Only shows loans with status 'active' (funds released)
  - Pending loans: Shows all loans except terminal statuses (active, rejected, cancelled, completed, closed, repaid, defaulted, written_off)

## Recent Changes (December 1, 2025)

- **Transfer Menu Redesign:** Removed "Transfert en attente" status - now displays only "Transfert en cours" (in-progress, funds available) and "Transfert Terminé" (completed, 100% transfer).
- **Dashboard Borrowed Amount:** Immediately displays borrowed amount when user submits a loan request (includes "pending" loans, not just "active").
- **Admin Pages Real-Time Updates:** Added auto-refresh polling (refetchInterval: 2000) to AdminLoans, AdminTransfers, and AdminReports pages with refetchIntervalInBackground: true for continuous updates even when tab is not focused.
- **PDF Filename Translation:** Fully translated amortization schedule filenames based on user language (tableau-amortissement-FR, amortization-schedule-EN, tabla-amortizacion-ES, etc.).

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Technology Stack:** React 18 (TypeScript), Wouter, Tailwind CSS (with shadcn/ui), Zustand, TanStack Query, React Hook Form (with Zod), Vite.

**API Design:** RESTful API with response formatting and request logging.
**Data Layer:** Schema-first design using Drizzle ORM, type-safe operations, Zod schemas, drizzle-kit for migrations.
**Storage Strategy:** PostgreSQL (`DatabaseStorage`) with Neon serverless, adhering to an `IStorage` interface.
**Database Schema:** Includes tables for `users`, `loans`, `transfers`, `fees`, `transactions`, `adminSettings`, `auditLogs`, `transferValidationCodes`, `transferEvents`, `adminMessages`, `externalAccounts`, `userOtps`, and `kycDocuments`.

- **Signed Contracts:** Local file system storage (`uploads/signed-contracts/`) with PDF validation.
- **Chat File Storage:** Supabase Storage integration using presigned URLs for secure, time-limited uploads/downloads.
- **Notification System:** Database-backed persistent notifications with RESTful API, user ownership, `NotificationBell` component (polling, unread badges, sound alerts), 2FA suggestion, multilingual support for 18 critical events.
- **Loan Workflow Enhancement:** 3-stage contract lifecycle with `status` and `contractStatus` fields.
