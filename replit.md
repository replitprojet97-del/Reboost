## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Technology Stack:**
- **Framework:** React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing:** Wouter (lightweight React router)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library (New York style variant)
- **State Management:** Zustand for client-side state (themes, language preferences)
- **Data Fetching:** TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **Forms:** React Hook Form with Zod validation via @hookform/resolvers
- **Build Tool:** Vite

**Design System:**
- Component library based on Radix UI primitives with extensive customization
- Custom design tokens defined in CSS variables (HSL color system)
- Typography system using Google Fonts (Inter/Work Sans for UI, JetBrains Mono for financial figures)
- Responsive breakpoint strategy (mobile-first, md, lg breakpoints)
- Consistent spacing primitives (Tailwind scale: 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24)

**Internationalization (i18n):**
- Custom i18n implementation using Zustand for language state
- Translation keys stored in `client/src/lib/i18n.ts`
- Supported languages: French (default), English, Spanish
- Language selection persisted in localStorage

**Theming:**
- Light/dark mode toggle
- Theme state managed via Zustand with localStorage persistence
- CSS variable-based color system for seamless theme switching

**Component Architecture:**
- Atomic design approach with reusable UI components in `client/src/components/ui/`
- Feature-specific components in `client/src/components/`
- Page-level components in `client/src/pages/`
- Example components for development/testing in `client/src/components/examples/`

### Backend Architecture

**Technology Stack:**
- **Runtime:** Node.js with Express.js
- **Language:** TypeScript (ES modules)
- **ORM:** Drizzle ORM
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (via Neon serverless driver)
- **Session Management:** Connect-pg-simple for PostgreSQL-backed sessions

**API Design:**
- RESTful API endpoints prefixed with `/api`
- Demo mode using hardcoded user ID (`demo-user-001`)
- Response formatting with comprehensive data transformation
- Request logging middleware for debugging

**Data Layer:**
- Schema-first design with Drizzle ORM
- Type-safe database operations using generated TypeScript types
- Zod schemas for runtime validation (via drizzle-zod)
- Migration support via drizzle-kit

**Storage Strategy:**
- **Production Implementation**: PostgreSQL database via `DatabaseStorage` class (server/storage.ts)
- **Database Connection**: Neon serverless PostgreSQL accessed through `server/db.ts`
- **Legacy Reference**: In-memory storage implementation (`MemStorage`) preserved as commented code for reference
- **Interface Abstraction**: `IStorage` interface ensures consistent API across storage implementations
- **Automatic Seeding**: Demo data automatically initialized on first database connection
- **Migration Management**: Database schema updates via `npm run db:push` using Drizzle Kit

**Database Schema:**
```
users (id, username, password, email, fullName, accountType, role, status, kycStatus, maxLoanAmount, suspendedUntil, suspensionReason, externalTransfersBlocked, transferBlockReason, createdAt, updatedAt)
loans (id, userId, loanType, amount, interestRate, duration, status, approvedAt, approvedBy, rejectedAt, rejectionReason, nextPaymentDate, totalRepaid, deletedAt, deletedBy, deletionReason, createdAt)
transfers (id, userId, amount, recipient, status, currentStep, validationMethod, createdAt, updatedAt)
fees (id, userId, feeType, reason, amount, relatedMessageId, isPaid, paidAt, createdAt)
transactions (id, userId, type, amount, description, createdAt)
adminSettings (id, settingKey, settingValue, description, updatedBy, updatedAt)
auditLogs (id, adminId, action, targetType, targetId, details, createdAt)
transferValidationCodes (id, transferId, sequence, code, expiresAt, usedAt, createdAt)
transferEvents (id, transferId, eventType, eventData, createdAt)
adminMessages (id, userId, subject, content, isRead, readAt, createdAt)
externalAccounts (id, userId, accountType, accountName, iban, bic, createdAt)
```

**Key Architectural Decisions:**

1. **Monorepo Structure:** Client and server code coexist with shared TypeScript types in `/shared` directory
2. **Type Safety:** End-to-end type safety from database schema to frontend components
3. **Development Mode:** Vite middleware mode for seamless HMR during development
4. **Production Build:** Separate client (Vite) and server (esbuild) builds with static file serving
